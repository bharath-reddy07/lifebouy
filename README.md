# LIFEBOUY

This project is built to help people during natural disasters like floods, earthquakes,etc. We collect data from the users with the help of a captive portal, this data is transmitted back to the host node via Bluetooth. The host node then uploads this data to a cloud database.We also developed a website that provided a graphic visualization of the data collected. The use case is that in natural disasters like flood, all communication infrastructure breaks down, leaving
victims to fend for themselves, thus this system was made to collect distress information during floods or any other natural disaster.

## Features

- The mesh network is made up of multiple floating devices
- These devices create a captive portal that users can connect to and communicate their status
- Many such devices are monitored by a host device, which is relayed over to a rescue station
- The data (user location and status) goes through multiple devices before arriving at the host devices
- All the data can be monitored at the rescue station through an interactive dashboard
- System is fully self-sustained and doesnâ€™t require any external infrastructure like Internet or Cellular Network
